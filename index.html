                <p> My name is Corey Yates.  I received a Bachelor's Degree in US History from the Univesity of California at Berkeley in 2006.  My love of history, women and fashion lead me to start a business in 1999 that sells vintage sewing patterns. Our business has grown from an Ebay business to Etsy and our own website, 
                    <a href="https://www.vintage4me2.com" target="_blank">Vintage4me2.com.</a>
                    </p>
                <p> I am looking forward to using this class to grow both my business and my proffessional resume to work on websites for other small businesses.
                    I have mastered important programs and web applications like Shopify and Mailchimp.  I run successful email and social media campaigns to keep people interested in Vintage Sewing. </p>
                    <p> When we started this business in 1999, the web was very different than today, we helped to grow a niche market in Vintage Patterns into a fun and vibrant corner of the web.  Please join my facebook group to get a sense of the world of vintage sewing patterns</p>
